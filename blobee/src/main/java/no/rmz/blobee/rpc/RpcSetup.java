/**
 * Setting up an RPC endpoint is about doing these three things:
 *
 *    o Make a client instance that can be used to send and
 *      accept requests.
 *    o Make a service instance that can be used to serve and
 *      return requests.
 *    o Either
 *        - Either connect to a server accepting incoming connection and use
 *          that connection to exchange RPC calls.
 *        - Or  set up a server accepting incoming connections and use those
 *          connections to serve incoming requests.
 *
 * So you see, there is a great deal of symmetry here.  A client is also
 * a server and a server is also a client.   This symmetry is not currently
 * reflected in the way we build the server and client instances, but
 * it should.  There should be -very- little difference between the two.
 *
 * Perhaps the main construct should be an "RpcPeer" and then secondarily
 * we should extract either a client or a server depending on our needs?
