1. Run these

   mvn release:clean
   mvn release:prepare
  
  The prepare-step will fail, but it will do so after it has 
  produced the necessary artifacts, but before they have
  been packaged for release.

2. Use bin/makebundle.sh to make a release bundle.

3. Upload the bundle to https://oss.sonatype.org/ using the description in https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide.
    (beware that the UI has changed a lot since that documentation was written).
