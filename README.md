How hard can it be to write an RPC framework?
=============================================


Well, the only way to find out is to try I guess, so that's what I'm
doing.  Call it a finger exercise, a design study, whatever. It's not
something that useful for anyone for anything, but do feel free to
take a look and if you find it interesting please tell me. If you send
me a pull request i'll be ecstatic ;-)

Btw, there is no license tagged on to anything here, but when I get 
around to it I'll open source this by tagging an Apache 2 license
to everything.
