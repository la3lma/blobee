How hard can it be to write an RPC framework?
=============================================


Well, the only way to find out is to try I guess, so that's what I'm
doing.  Call it a finger exercise, a design study, whatever. It's not
something that useful for anyone for anything, but do feel free to
take a look and if you find it interesting please tell me. If you send
me a pull request i'll be ecstatic ;-)

Btw, there is no license tagged on to anything here, but when I get 
around to it I'll open source this by tagging an Apache 2 license
to everything.


How to use the RPC library
==========================

The blobee library is now in a pre-alpha state, but it's finished
enough for me to ask for input from other developers.  I know there
are many strange things in the source code, so I'm actually not so
interested in comments on that since I'm in the process of cleaning
it up already.  The  user-facing API however is something I very much
would like to have to get feedback about, so if feel free to give
it  try and please do send me feedback (to la3lma@gmail.com).

Even if you don't write your own servers and clients, please take a look
at the example code below and comment on it.  I really need for
feedback from someone else now :-)

* Clone it from github 

           git clone git://github.com/la3lma/blobee.git

* Compile

           mvn clean install

* Write some code that uses it.   You should  include something like this
   in your pom.xml file.  It will only work if you've compiled the library
   locally, since nothing has been uploaded to maven central yet.

        <dependency>
            <groupId>no.rmz</groupId>
            <artifactId>blobee</artifactId>
            <version>1-0.SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>

*  Write some code.   This is a test program from the  project itself, 
   but it should be able to serve as a template both for writing clients
   and servers.
