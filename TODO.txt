o Make what we've got now work.  Passing tests etc.  Build on success.  Right now
  things are starting to become unbound.

o Make a proper RPC channel implementation based on the alternating channel thing.
  o Start by making an RPC channel for the client side, then verify
    that proper parameters are sent in from it, then extend by adding
    a serving component.
o Start formulating a plan to let us get away with very little, or preferably
  no code generation!
o Test that we can use  blobee on RPC code that is not part of blobee (checking
  that we don't screw ut things from a classloader's perspective).
o Make some performance tests.  Nothing fancy, but they should be there
  from not very far into the future and forever, with historical record.
