o Make a proper RPC channel implementation based on the alternating channel thing.
o Test that we can use  blobee on RPC code that is not part of blobee (checking
  that we don't screw ut things from a classloader's perspective).
o Make some performance tests.  Nothing fancy, but they should be there
  from not very far into the future and forever, with historical record.
