o Add protobuffers.  The thing to do would probably be to
  add a payload field to the RpcParam/RpcResult interfaces
  and let that field be a protobuffer-defined something. 
  The next step would be to let RpcParam and RpcResult
  themselves be protobuffer defined.

o The question I want to answer first is: Is it easy to 
  nest independent protobuffer definitions?

o When that thing works, we can start setting up
  some netty based service and see how fast we can
  send things through it.

o Then we need to really start get to work on the API.
