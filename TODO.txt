o Ok, so the method invocation stuff in Protobuffers isn't half
  bad, but it's a bit complex to use, so perhaps wrapping it in
  some suger-coating annotation syntax would be nice?   Take

o Also push stuff through the wire. Use netty.

o Then we need to really start get to work on the API,
  connecting the clients through netty etc.
