o Make the currently failing test pass instead.

o Explain the design to Sverre and get some friendly but critical
  feedback.

o Refactor a lot, add comments, dot "i"s cross "t"s. Javadoc everything,
  enhance test coverage, but don't add many new features.  
  Consolidate, consolidate.

o Refactor tests somewhat so that they are in fact not as hardwired as
  today, but uses parametrization techniques from the implementation 
  instead.

o Make more independent tests for:

   -> Performance (as soon as a stable API is 
      available (arguably it is today).  Run from command line
      as an independent java app.

   -> Service from somewhere else than the master ptotobuf declaration that
      we currently use for everything.


o Start formulating a plan to let us get away with very little, or preferably
  no code generation!

o Test that we can use  blobee on RPC code that is not part of blobee (checking
  that we don't screw ut things from a classloader's perspective).

o Make some performance tests.  Nothing fancy, but they should be there
  from not very far into the future and forever, with historical record.
